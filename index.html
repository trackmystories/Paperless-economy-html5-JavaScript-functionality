<h2>"We are shifting from paper to screen"</h2>
<h3>What would Money be in a paperless economy?</h3>
<h1>by Ali Sherazee</h1>

<p>Imagine a paperless economy, where the dependecies on paper is made reduntant and technology as a form of written and
visual expression is adopted.</p>
<p> What would this mean? How would historians relate to it looking back a millenium from now?
Would paper be exihibited in museums? or would they continue to be as they are?</p>




<div class="row" class="responsive">
<div class="column">
<p>January 1st, 1983 is a date that changed the world forever.
On this date the World-Wide-Web was created by a computer scientist name
<a href="https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.
and the world has transformed into a far smaller place to interact in.</p>
<p> The creation of the internet brought in a new kind of renaissance, Art is being expressed like never before
and that very expression was evolving as technology evolved and continues to evolve to this day. Where things seem archaic
just 10 years ago on how content looked essentially perceived.</p>

  <h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The layout and structure of the web has rapidily evolved since it's inception. what was once expressed on paper
is now transformed on to the browser. consider a simple webpage as this one and compare it to the <i>like</i> button on facebook, which gives the user the power
to dynamically express themselves out loud and take action that tracends borders. A simple <i>like</i> on a newsfeed is seen and interpreted across borders in real time.</p>

<div class="column" width="800">
  <h3>Money</h3>
<p>Consider the notion of money and how it has evolved since the birth of the World Wide Web. Digital transaction such as, Paypal, Visa and other forms the birth of blockchain and formation of crypto currencies such as bitcoin, ethrium and stable coins such as Facebook's libra coin.

  <h3>A paperless economy?</h3>
<p>So what would a paperless economy mean? Would it be any different than our day to day e-commerce transaction or would this
evolve further? </p>
