<h1>by Ali Shirazee</h1>

<p>Imagine a paperless economy, where the dependecies of paper are made reduntant and technologies as a form of written and
visual expression is adopted,</p>
<p> what would this mean? How would historians relate to it looking back a millenium for now?
Would papers be exihibited in museams? or would they continue to be as they are?</p>
